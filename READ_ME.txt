INSTALLATION
------------
Linklint is a plain old Perl programs so you can always run it
(from the command line) as:

   perl linklint-X.X.X  [parameters]

You need to have Perl installed on your system (version 5.004 or
greater).  For convenience, (on Unix) you may want to rename it to
"linklint" and move it to a directory that is on your path.

See the file INSTALL.unix or INSTALL.windows for more details.


Enjoy.
